# 🎙️🖼️ Voice to Image Generation using OpenAI Whisper & DALL·E

This project showcases a simple multimodal AI system that transforms **spoken language into visual imagery** using OpenAI’s state-of-the-art models — Whisper for **speech recognition** and DALL·E for **image generation**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎧 Converts speech to text using **Whisper API**
- 🧠 Generates AI artwork from the transcribed text using **DALL·E**
- ⚡ Streamlined for quick prototyping and experimentation
- 🌐 Built with simplicity — works right inside Jupyter or Colab!

## 🏁 How to Run

1. Download or open the notebook (`Voice_To_Image_Gen_Using_Dall_E.ipynb`)
2. Open it in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter Notebook
3. Install the required packages (in a new cell if needed):
4. Add your OpenAI API key
5. Upload a short audio file (e.g., .mp3, .wav)
6. Run all cells to see your spoken ideas turn into images ✨
